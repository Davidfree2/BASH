Hello! This is a super simple and easy script i created that creates a file then moves you into that folder immediatly after. 
This removed the need for mkdir <filename> && cd <filename> 

For this to work make sure you source the file every time you run it. That way you don't create a child process everytime. 

To run this file using source simple type dot then the command 

Example: 
. ./cm.sh

or

source ./cm.sh
